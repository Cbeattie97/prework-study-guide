# Prework Study Guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to ready myself for an upcoming coding bootcamp and to expand my knowledge within the area. 
This Study guide was created to demonstrate the structure, stylng and intercativity of a basic webpage, utilising HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also served as a purposeful way to learn to navigate using command line, practice good version control with Github and to write code using VS code. 
The use of all the above tools and practices results in a functioning webpage.
